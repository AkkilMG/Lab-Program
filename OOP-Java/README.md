#### 1 b) In the IT company, there are 21 employees and monthly salary of employees must be arranged in ascending order. Write java program to read 21 employee salaries as floating point numbers and apply for each to perform the sorting, and display the result. Also, the industry places the highest paid employee in the first level and next three highest paid employees in third level, and soon.

### Problem 2

#### 2 a) There are n people standing in a circle ready to be executed. The counting out starts at some point in the circle and proceeds around the circle in a fixed direction. In every step, a certain no. of people are skipped and the next individual is executed. The removal proceeds around the circle until last person remains, who is given freedom. Given the total no. of person N and a no. k which indicates that k-1 persons are skipped and the kth person is removed in a circle. The task is to choose the place in the initial circle so that you are the last one remaining and so survive.

#### 2 b) In a financial application computing the CD value, where CD value is the certificate of deposite allows you to save money at a fixed interest rate for a fixed amount of time. Suupose you put INR 10,000 into a CD with an annual percentage yield of 5.75%. After one month, the CD is worth INR 10,047.91 calculated as 10000+1*(5.75/12*100). Write a program using appropriate class and objects that prompts the user to enter an amount, the annual percentage yield, and the number of months and display.

### Problem 3

#### 3 a) Chef is going for vacations on hill station this winter and is willing to go to the following destination: Manali, Massoorie, Gulmarg. Further he wants to explore the places by knowing the location, the place is famous for and the authentic dishes available in the places develop a java program to display the above information based on chef's destination points.

#### 3 b) There is a Vehicle class that encapsulates information about vehicles including the vehicle number, their fuel capacity and their fuel consumption rate. Use the Vehicle class a starting point from which more specialized classes are developed. For example, one type of vehicle is Truck to carry its cargo capacity. Thus to create a Truck class extend the Vehicle class, adding an instance variable that stores the goods carrying capacity. One more type of vehicle is Bus to carry people with a seating capacity. Use the approximate access specifier the data members and the methods are provided to read and display their values.
